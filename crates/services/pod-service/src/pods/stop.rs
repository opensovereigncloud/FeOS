//! A planned stop of a feosd whose microVMs end with it, as in a pod on
//! Kubernetes (ADR 0020), and the start after it. The stop refuses every
//! call that changes a pod from then on, suspends every running pod into
//! its directory (ADR 0008), as SuspendPod does, a few at a time, and
//! records which, in a file that outlives feosd. The next feosd resumes
//! them, a few at a time, and removes the record.
//!
//! A pod whose VM is busy (`vmm::is_busy`), as while Firecracker still
//! writes a snapshot that a suspend gave up on, is tried again after the
//! first pass over all pods, until the stop's grace ends.
//!
//! A record that a feosd before this one left also names the pods it
//! suspended and this one has not resumed yet: a stop during the resumes
//! keeps them. A pod whose resume fails stays suspended, and is not
//! resumed again by the next start: the control plane sees it suspended.
