//! A gate between the tests' feosd and diskd: feosd reaches diskd through
//! it, on a socket of the tests' own, and it holds the calls a test names,
//! or diskd's answers to them, so that the test can act while a
//! hibernation is at a step of its choosing. Every other call it forwards
//! as it is. A call that feosd drops drops the gate's own call to diskd,
//! whose handler stops as when feosd calls diskd directly.
